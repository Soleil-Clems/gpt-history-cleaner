## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

This extension is built with privacy as a core principle:

✅ No data collection — we don't collect, store, or transmit any personal information  
✅ No external servers — all operations are performed locally in your browser  
✅ No tracking or analytics — your usage data stays with you  
✅ Minimal permissions — only accesses chatgpt.com when you're logged in  
✅ Open source — the code is fully transparent and auditable  

We believe extensions should respect your privacy, not exploit it.
