## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

This extension is built with **privacy as a core principle**:

- ✅ **No data collection** — we don't collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- ✅ **No external servers** — all operations are performed locally in your browser
- ✅ **No tracking or analytics** — your usage data stays with you
- ✅ **Minimal permissions** — only accesses `chatgpt.com` when you're logged in
- ✅ **Open source** — the code is fully transparent and auditable

**We believe extensions should respect your privacy, not exploit it.**

## 🔐 Permissions Explained

The extension requests minimal permissions:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `host_permissions: "https://chatgpt.com/*"` | To inject the UI and interact with ChatGPT's conversation list |
| `scripting` | To execute code that adds checkboxes and handles bulk actions |

**That's it.** No access to cookies, no access to other websites, no unnecessary permissions.
